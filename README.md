# Webscraping_Books

The .py file can be used to create a CSV file containing information for books that are considered to be in-stock, in which the information for said books were scraped from the following website: http://books.toscrape.com/. This is a public website created with the intention of allowing programmers to practice webscraping ethically.

The CSV file created is also in the repository.
